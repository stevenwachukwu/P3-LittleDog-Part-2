The find() function.
• As shown in class, initialize the scan pointer to the head of the list and the
prior pointer to nullptr.
• In a 2-pointer walk, always set prior = scan before you change scan to scan-
>next.
• Do a 2-pointer walk down the list until scan points at a cell whose data is greater
than the new data.
• Return. At this point, prior is pointing to the cell that should precede the new cell.
The insert() function.
• Call find() to position the scan and prior pointers on your linked list.
• Instantiate a new Cell containing the line of text you just read and pointing to
whatever scan
currently points to.
• Then check prior: if it is nullptr, make head point at the new cell. Otherwise,
make the cell that prior points at point at the new cell.
• If you do this in the right order, it is four lines of code.
